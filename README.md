# 3D Graphics Demo

This project demonstrates 3D graphics using Matplotlib in Python. It allows users to visualize and interact with various 3D shapes through wireframes, with features to transform and manipulate these shapes using sliders and radio buttons.

## Features

- Visualization of 3D shapes (cube, pyramid, etc.)
- Interactive transformation of shapes (rotation, translation)
- Real-time updates of transformations
- GUI with sliders for transformations and radio buttons for shape selection

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-name/3d_effect_matrix.git
    cd 3d_effect_matrix
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**
    ```bash
    make run
    ```

2. **Interact with the GUI**
    - Use the sliders to rotate and translate the selected shape.
    - Use the radio buttons to switch between different shapes.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
